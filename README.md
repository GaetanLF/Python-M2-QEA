# Python-M2-QEA

This is a data science project that is part of the course "Python for Data Science" taught by Prof. Khalil El Marsi. 

The project team works on: Task 10 Metabolic Syndrome Analysis
Metabolic syndrome is a combination of conditions that significantly raise the risk of a multitude of diseases (coronary heart disease, diabetes, etc.). The hospital you are working at wants to identify, based on historical clinical data, the most important factors linked to this syndrome.

The git repo contains
- main.py: main file containing all the code of data analysis
- streamlit_app.py - code for an online app designed to predict patterns of metabolic syndrome in patients
- requirements.txt - requirement file to install all packages needed to operate the code in a virtual environment

Folders
- Data: contains the historical patient data
- Visualisations: contains all the graphics produced by the code

Short abstract on the project:
Over the past decades, metabolic syndrome has been an emerging disease in line with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes. As symptoms linked to metabolic syndrome are highly intertwined and complex, this report analyses data on 2009 patients. The paper contributes to the current research by investigating the distribution of risk factors in both women and men, identifying the key drivers of metabolic syndrome and designing a predictive algorithm to classify patients suffering from the disease using a decision-tree. Based on the analysis, the report recommends three policies to improve the efficiency in diagnosing incoming patients.
